NAME
       sch-magic-num-find - Search for instance of 5-digit magic-num 
       in /usr/bin/sch-*. If found, report linenumber and filespec on stdout. 
       Search is non-recursive at present as that seems more convenient.

SYNOPSIS
       sch-magic-num [5-DIGIT-NUM]

EXIT STATUS
       0      If file containing magic number found.
       1      If no such file found.
       stdout <filespec><" line "><line-num> if file found, otherwise null

USAGE

EOF
}

MagicNum="$1"; FileSpec=''; Problem=''; LineNum=''

[ "$MagicNum" != '' ] || { echo "missing argument"; exit 1; }

# TODO: validate that MagicNum is indeed a 5-digit number

FileSpec="$(grep --line-number $MagicNum /usr/bin/sch-* |head -n1 |cut -d: -f1)"
LineNum="$(grep --line-number $MagicNum /usr/bin/sch-* |head -n1 |cut -d: -f2)"
echo "$FileSpec line $LineNum"
[ "$LineNum" != '' ] || exit 1
exit 0
